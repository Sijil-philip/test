Fivetran connectors in Databricks data ingestion enable automated and seamless data movement from various sources (databases, SaaS applications, cloud storage, etc.) into Databricks for analytics and processing. These connectors provide:  

- **Automated ETL**: Fully managed pipelines that extract, transform, and load data into Databricks with minimal configuration.  
- **Incremental Data Syncs**: Efficient updates by capturing only new or changed data, reducing processing overhead.  
- **Pre-Built Connectors**: Supports hundreds of sources like MySQL, PostgreSQL, Salesforce, Google Analytics, and more.  
- **Schema Management**: Automatically adapts to schema changes without manual intervention.  
- **Integration with Delta Lake**: Ensures data consistency, performance, and scalability within Databricks.  

Fivetran simplifies the ingestion process, allowing teams to focus on data analysis rather than maintaining pipelines.
